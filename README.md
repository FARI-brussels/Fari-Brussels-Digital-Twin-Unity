# Brussels Digital Twin TrafficTwin

This project is an initiative by **FARI- AI for the Common Good**, to create an interactive digital twin of the city of Brussels. Developed with Unity, it enables real-time visualization, simulation and analysis of urban data to support research, urban planning and citizen participation.

## Objectives
- **3D Visualization**: Represent Brussels in an immersive and interactive environment.
- **Simulation**: Test urban scenarios like mobility.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Connect to live data streams from open APIs and sensors.

## Project Architecture

The project consists of several key components:

- **Unity Engine**: Handles 3D rendering and user interactions.
- **C# Scripts**: Implement the simulation logic, UI behaviors, and data connections.
- **Cesium for Unity** : Implement precise earth visualization
- **Data Modules**: Import and process geospatial and temporal datasets.
